classes of the population.¹ The author had made various
observations on the geological structure of the country, and
with his partial knowledge he tries to find an explanation of
them. The current belief of the time, that gold was to be found
in Iceland, he refutes by declar-ing the mineral popularly taken
for that precious metal to be pyrites, As to preternatural
beings in human form he apparently shares to a certain degree
the popular belief3 seemingly he has no great faith in the
existence of giants or trolls—he at least takes it for certain that
they were extinct, but elves or fairies he treats as if they still
existed, although he acknowledges the difficulty of ascertaining
the accuracy of some of the stories told concerning them, suspect-
ing, here as elsewhere, the tricks and deceptions of the devil.

Altogether the Dc mirabilibus is an interesting work, and one
could wish that the author had expressed himself at greater
length on the topics he treats of. As it is, it presents the out-
look of an educated man of the seventeenth century on the
nature surrounding him ; and it is pleasant to observe the author’s
love of the subject. His patriotism and his pride in the nation
are everywhere evident—yet he does not wish to seem “ vanam
gloriam patriae venditare.’' The work stands out as the best of
its kind written in Iceland during the seventeenth century.
Compared with the similar works of Jon Guomundsson and
J6n Dadason, we see that it represents as critical a treatment as
one could expect in that age. Being written in Latin, it
naturally appealed to educated readers, whereas the two authors
just mentioned wrote in the vernacular, and· represent a more
popular view of thingS‚ while they draw also upon kindred
publications of foreign writerS.¹ Now all these works are of
importance for the study of Icelandic folk-lore.

²J6n Gubmundsson, often called “the learned ’‘ (1574—ca. 1650), wrote
Um islands adskiljanlegar ndttdrur and T idsfordrif. J 611 Dabason (ca.
1606-76) wrote near the middle of the sixteenth century his Gandreid.
