but only notes or disconnected chapters on various topics related
to the geography of Iceland. Accordingly, no one thus far had
attempted a connected description of the natural phenomena of
Iceland, and it was precisely this task that Bishop Gisli under-
took when he wrote De mirabilibm. The want of such a work
was felt at the time by Icelanders and foreigners alike, and
Bishop Gisli had many qualifications for producing it. He was
interested in natural science‚ had doubtless read a great deal of
it, and possibly had devoted some time to the study of it while
in the University. From personal observation he knew the
country better than most of his contemporaries ; as a youth he
had traveled with his father on the latter's tours of inspection
through the diocese ; and after he had become bishop himself,
the visitation of the various parishes was one of his episcopal
dutie5.¹ Further‚ he had at least traveled over parts of the
Holar diocese, his father-in-law being one of the leading men in
that section of the country.

The author begins De mirabilibus by describing the geogra-
phical position of Iceland ; but he frankly confesses his inability
to determine it through his own calculations ; instead, he
appeals to other authorities, quoting Hans Nansen and Peter
ApianuS, as well as his father, Bishop Oddur. It is strange,
however, that he does not mention Bishop Guflbrandur of Hola‘r,
who was the first to succeed in determining with tolerable ac-
curacy the geographical position of Iceland, and who up to this
time had made the best map of the country.' The next chapter
deals with the polar ice and the things connected with it. Then
follows a description of meteors and other aerial phenomena, to
which, in the scientific opinion of the time, earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions were related. The author then treats of
monsters and serpents in lakeS, riverS, and the ocean, dwelling
upon them at some length, after which he passes on to the de-
scription of whales and fishes, including among the latter
molluscs and echinodermS. Five chapters are devoted to birds,
