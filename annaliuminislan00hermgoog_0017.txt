phrasing is often clearer, and in a few cases better ; some entries
are fuller, others briefer, and some entirely omitted: and the
handwriting seems to be more careful. The second opinion is
primarily based upon the confusion of the chronological arrange-
ment and the omissions in B. And this is probably the correct
view ; B is the original draft, the conclusion and the subscrip-
tion, however, having been added to it from A. The edition
printed below is based upon A, variants being given only where
there is a difference of some consequence between the two,
The items which occur in both are in this edition marked with
an asterisk.

In the author’s mind the two works supplement one another ;
both deal with what he calls “ mirabilia Islandiae,” the Annalium
farrago giving a historical record of natural and preternatural
occurrences in Iceland, the De mirabilibus being a general de·
scription of the country, its animate and inanimate nature. For
the general history of the country the former is of but slight im-
portance, since ordinary events as a rule are not recorded, but
principally occurrences of an extraordinary character, such as
floOdS, volcanic eruptionS, pestilenceS, disasters on land and sea,
apparitions of various kinds, the spontaneous ringing of bens,
comets, the appearence of monsters in rivers and lakeS, monstrous
births, ghost stories, and the like. Because of this it has been
styled‚ not without reason, the first collection of Icelandic folk-
lore. It contains a few genuine font-tales complete,¹ and others
in embryo.' For the author, most of it represented records of

¹1n Huld VI, 1898, pp. 37-51, Dr. J6n Porkelsson has published in an
Icelandic translation some of the tales from the Annals (cf. also p. 28 be-
low), and three chapters from the De mirabilibus.

'Such, for instance, is the story about the Skibastabir farm (1547).
Bjorn J6nsson ὁ, Skarbsa (Anndlar, 1774, p. 69) mentions the event, which
he dates in 1545. According to him 14 men were killed by the landelide,
and no trace of them was found except the right hand of the farmer whose
name was Saemundur ; it was therefore interpreted by the ple, that this
hand was to have Christian burial, because mth it Saemun ur had so often
given alrns to the poor. Yet thifflss contrary to the farmer’s character as it

ever, no mention is made of the shepher , while a maid-servant is saved
through the interference of a raven, an incident borrowed from other
tales; cf. the story of the girl at Gullberastabir (fsl. pjboso’gur 1, p.
617-618), and the story of He 'olfur and Vilborg obul.. 11, p. 81). he
incident of the hand is attache to another tale in which a far-mer of B'arna-
stabit in Vatnsdalur, called Saemundur, is mentioned as having been illed

by a landslide in 1720 (cf. “ Draugurinn Kinni,” ibid, I, p. 342).
