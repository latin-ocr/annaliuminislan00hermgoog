viii ISLANDICA

The account of the suicide ( 161 1) is illuminating on the popular
attitude at that time toward such actS. The selection of the
items included in the annals was doubtless the work of Bishop
Gisli himself, but the Latin translation was principally made by
Ketill Jorundsson,¹ a friend and confident of the bishop and his
family, whom the bishop, shortly before his death, ordained as
minister to Hvammur, this being the last ordination he performed.

The Annalium farrago was finished on July 24, 1637 ; the De
mirabilibus was begun on April 18, of the following year, and
finished on May 1, 1638, only two months before the author's
death. The work was thus written in about two weekS. But
the author had long been planning some such work, as is evident
from his letter to Dr. Ole Worm, dated July 31, 1635. In this
letter Bishop Gisli writes : “ Sperabam aliqvando, mihi hoc otii
relictum iri, inter occupationes plurimaS, ut pauca qvaedam an·
notarem, in gratiam Magnif. Dni Cancellarii,¹ de Lapidibus et
Herbis et qvibusdam aliis mirandis hujus Insulae, qvae doctissi-
mus Arngrimus sicco pede fere transiit, fortean qvia non ipse
totam Insulam perlustravit, sicut ego nunc aliqvoties maximam
partem. Sed iste foetus futurus est mihi fere elephantinus Si
autem qvicqvam concepi, non qvidem, propter sterilitatem
ingenii mei, luce dignum patiar tamen aliqvando, Deo adjuvante,
ut sub tanti Viri auspiciis pateat.''⁸ To this Worm replied in
his letter of May 6, 1636 ε “ Gratum fuit Cancellario Naturalia

 

¹Ketill Jorundsson (b. 1603, d. 1670) graduated from the Skalholt Ca-
thedral School in 1620, and was under-teacher (heyrari) there until 1622 ;
in that year he matriculated as a student in the University of Copenhagen,
but he returned to Iceland in the following year, and there resumed his
former position as teacher—which he held until 1638. He was minister of
Hvammur in Dalasysla from 1638 to 1667. In 1631-32, he accompanied
Bishop Gisli on his trip to copenhagen. He is known as an industrious

²Christian Friis til Kragerup (1581-1639) was Royal Chancellor from 1616
until his death. He was known for his interest in science and literature, and
especially in history ; the writers of the day found a friend and protector
in him.

pearance of the Hvita serpent in the same year had caused him to think of
writing about these things. He asserts that on this occasion he himself
saw the serpent, but it is strange that he did not put it on record in the
A nnalium farrago, with the other appearances of the monster.
