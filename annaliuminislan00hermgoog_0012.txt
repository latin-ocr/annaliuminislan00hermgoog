INTRODUCTION.

Gisli Oddsson was born in Skalholt in 1593, as the second son
of Bishop Oddur Einarsson and his wife Helga Jonsd6ttir, a
great-granddaughter of Bishop J6n Arason of H6lar. Gisli be-
gan his education at the Skalholt Cathedral School 3 on Oct. 8,
1613, he was matriculated as a student in the University of
Copenhagen,¹ where he remained only two years or SO,² since we
find him in the autumn of 1616 minister of the Skalholt Ca·
thedral. In 1621 he became rector of the Cathedral School‚ and
· in the following year minister of Stafholt. The next year he was
appointed 'minister of Holt undir Eyjafjollum, a living which. he
held until 1631. Bishop Oddur died Dec. 28, 1630, his death
being followed on Feb. 12, 1631, by that of Gisli Hakonarson‚
the lawman of the Southern and Eastern QuarterS. Thus the
two highest officeS‚ ecclesiastical and secular, in that part of the
country were vacant at the same time. The family of the late
bishop put his two sons forward as candidates for these positions
—Arni Oddsson for lawman, and Gisli Oddsson for bishop. But
the relatives of the late lawman and their adherents opposed the
candidacy of the bishop's sonS, having candidates of their own.
After a close contest the two brothers were finally elected at the
Althing‚ June 29, 1631,³ whereupon Gisli immediately repaired
to Denmark in order to obtain royal confirmation of his election.
After some hesitation, due, as it seems, to the efforts of the
opposing party, the king appointed Gisli bishop of the Skalholt
diocese. He was ordained by Bishop Hans Resen on Maunday·
Thursday, 1632, and in the spring of the same year he re-
turned to his see. His episcopale was, however, of short dura-
tion, as he died at Thingvellir‚ during a meeting of the Althing‚
on July 1, 1638.⁴ He had married in 1622 Gubrfin Bjornsddttir
' of MunkapVera ; she died eleven years later (1633).⁶
