take it that it was not from the pen of Bishop Gisli, but had
been added to the manuscript, or bound with it, by one of its
successive ownerS, and was probably removed by Finnur Mag-
nusson, who acquired the manuscript after Thorkelin’s death.'
Separated under three numberS, as described above, the present
manuscript was included in the collection of Icelandic manu-
scripts which Finnur Magnusson shortly after 1830 sold to the
Bodleian Library. He styles it in the printed catalogue³ the
author’s autograph manuscript ; but this is not quite correct,
since it is in three or four different handwritingS, the author's
hand being distinguishable only in the subscription at the end of
the one recension of the AnnaIS, and in a portion and in a few
‚corrections of the other recension. But if not actually in part
written by the author himself, it was without doubt copied
under his direction and supervision, and thus constitutes an
original manuscript. No other manuscripts of the two writings
are known to exist.

There are two recensions of the Annalium farragO. MS. Bor.
50 (A) has the fullest text, the entries being arranged in strictly
chronological order,⁴, while in MS. Bor. 51 (B) many items are
omitted, the chronological arrangement is not observed through-
out, and the title is lacking. Both contain the postscript, and
bear the same date at the end.⁶ The relation between the two is·
not perfectly clear ; it is a question whether, as Gustav Storm
thinks, on the authority of Chr. Collin (who examined the
manuscript for him), B represents a clean copy of certain
portions of A,⁶ or, as Jon Porkelsson thinks, B is merely a rough
draft.⁷ The first opinion is supported by the fact that in B the
