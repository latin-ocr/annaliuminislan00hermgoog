Icelandic.¹ Moreover, he was a close student of the history and
ancient records of his own country, and doubtless wrote some·
thing in this field. A man of studious habits, who devoted all
his leisure to reading and writing, he brought together in
Skalholt a considerable collection of books and manuscripts, and
employed se‘veral scribes as copyists ; unfortunately in 1630 the
see was visited by a disastrous fire, which destroyed practically
the whole library including the bishop’s own literary produc-
tions.² Bishop Gisli inherited his father’s love of learning,
although he declares himself not to be competent in his father’s
favorite subject, the mathematical scienceS. He seems to have
had a good knowledge of Icelandic history and traditionS. It
has recently been shown by Dr. Kr. Kaalund that Bishop Gisli
left an unfinished translation of Arngrimur J6nsson's Crymogoea.
The translator shows an ability to elucidate and discuss various
passages in the original.⁸ It waS, however, upon his knowledge
of natural science that Bishop Gisli’s reputation for learning
particularly rested among his comtemporaries. The writings in-
cluded in this volume are the only evidence we possess of his
knowledge in that province, and I shall return to it below. He is
said, moreover, to have been well versed in jurisprudence, and
especially in ecclesiastical laws⁴; and a good preacher he evi-
dently was, if popular tradition may be trustedf' He seems also

 

1of his translationS, some were printed, such as Passio (H61ar, 1620),
Habermann’s Prayer book (1621, etc..) and the Church Ordinance of 1607
·(H61ar, 1635). The translation of Heinrich Biinting’s Itinerarium Sacrae

Sm'pturae is preserved in manuscript (fo., Rvd., 36-37, 4t0).

² There is no account to be found of Bishop Oddur’s own library, but two
lists of the librar-y belonging to the see in 1604 and 1612 are printed in

Arbbk bins islenzka For-nletjfafblags, 1886, pp. 62-67.

XXIII, 1907, pp. 222 ff. The MS. is in Ny Kgl. Saml. 1281 fol.

⁴ In 1633 he translated into Icelandic the Ordinance of 1629 (manuscript.
in the copenhagen University Library, Steph. 58, St. Erichsens Saml. 5)s
Halfdan Einarsson says that Bishop Gisli “ scripisse dicitur de Actionibus
conjectura tantum nitentibus ” (Sczagrapkia, p. 194); but this work is now

1ost.

⁵In his Specimen Islandiae non barbarae ( J 611 Sig. Hdrsafn‚ 333, 4t0, pp.
228-229) Jon Thorchillius sayS, among other things about Bishop Gish:
“ cujus etsi nulla habemus scripta, constanti nihilominus fama celebratur
hic antistes ut juris ecclesiastici valde peritus nec non orator egregius. vel
