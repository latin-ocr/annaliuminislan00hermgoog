to have tried his hand at verse} very little, however, of his
poetry remainS.¹

The two writings printed in this volume exist in manuscript
in the Bodleian Library, Oxford ; the first in MSS. Bor. 50· 51,
4²⁰; the second in MS. Bor. 84, 4t0.' Although now separate,
these manuscripts have a continuous pagination (203 pp.),
which doubtless does not originate with the author, but is the
work of one of the former owners of the manuscript. The entire
manuscript was brought to Copenhagen‚ it would seem, shortly ·
before or after the author’s death, or about the middle of the

century⁸; for P. Resen made use of it in his work on Iceland. ,

Aside from this its history is unknown until Eggers mentions it
in his description of Iceland in 1786. It was at that time in the
possession of Grimur Thorkelin, the archivist, and according to
Eggers’ statement it then had 263 pp„ pp. 204·262 being oc·

Islandiae (sive Historiae naturalis insulae dictae Tentamen),” etc.

⁸ It is probably to the Annalium farrago that Bishop Gisli refers in a letter
to Worm, dated “in via visitationis, prope Akureyre in plaga septentrio-
nali, 8 Augusti, Anno 1637.'’ He writes as follows ε “ Cum navigio
Grindvicense schedulam incultam ad dignitatem vestram transmisi, ratus
fore, ut tempus subseqvens permitteret, plura ac meliora vobis dare ; sed
eventus ostendit, qvam adeo sim arctatus curiS, negotiJ'S, et molestiis varijs.
Nihil enim potui, praeter haec pauca et levia, Annalium patriae, qvae
qvamvis, propter styli humilitatem, non sint lectu digna; tamen, propter
rerum, tam varietatem, qvam veritatem, spero non omnino contemnenda.
Eadem autem, ut V. D. meo Nomine, humiliter offerat Magnifice Dn.
CancellariO, cum excusatione satis valida, non minus de mea ruditate, qvam
gravissimis occupationibuS.” According to this, the Annals were sent to
copenhagen before the De mirabilibus, The ‘⁴ transmissa scripta ‘’ were
received by Worm, but on account of the pestilence he delayed the de-
livery of them to the chancellor ( cf. letter of May 10, 1638, Epzstolce ΙΙ, p.
597). It is likely that the bishop in 1637 sent only the longer recension
(A), while he kept the other. This latter, I presume‚ was found after his
death among his pa erS, and probably was sent, together with the De
mirabilibus, to Copenhagen‚ either to Worm or Friis, referably to the former
and there the whole manuscript was united. It is oubtful whether it ever·
came into the possession of the chancellor, as he died on Oct. 1, 1639.
