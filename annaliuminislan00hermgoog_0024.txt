superstitious of the age, were we familiar with all the material
from which he selected his Annalium farrag0; for that work,
perhapS, would make clear his distinction between what he con-
sidered credible and what incredible. In the De mirabilibus he
frequently declares that he deems the popular stories and beliefs
which he mentions to be idle talk, or at best uncertain, and in
places he even apologizes for referring to them—sometimes he
reserves judgment until further proofs are forthcoming, His
whole treatment of the subject must be judged from the stand-
point of the scientists of his time. Natural science was then a
strange mixture of knowledge, tradition, and superstition ;
systematic divisions were lacking or imperfect, and the value of
observation and experience had not been fully established as
against tradition, popular or literary. Like most scientists of
his times Bishop Gisli vacillates in this respect, yet he usually
seeks for natural causes in explanation of the phenomena‚ in-
stead of assuming occult or mysterious influences at work be-
hind them. That he believed in the existence of monsters of
various kinds within the animal kingdom is not to be wondered
at ; the leading scientists of the time did the same, and treated
such creatures with all seriousness in their bookS.¹ Indeed the
belief in such things outlived the seventeenth century, and may
not be entirely extinct even in our timeS, at least among certain

observatores, nisi magistratus politicus cum aliqvibus conniveat, qvod
tamen non fiet, me sciente et volente ‘’ (AM. 267 fol. ). In a letter of July
31, 1635, Bishop Gisli again writes to Worm: “Superstitiones magicae,
laus Deo, ferme exularunt a patria nostra, aut minimum evacuatae sunt,
qvantum qvidem ego intellig0, et mihi sperare fas est ” (Epistolae 11, pp.
594—595).—In his circular letter of April 26, 1636, to the secular authorities,
he refers to the matter as follows: “ Munu nu enn ongver hrosa sier af
rfinum oc fiolkynge? Gustuk vaere pad valdsmonnum ad hafa ei slika
i mestum havegum, oc leita ecke haelis nie rada til peirra, helldur

etc. In 1637 e was a member of the court which confirmed the sentence
of exile upon J6n Gubmundsson for witchcraft, adding, however, a hint
to the king to pardon the defendant. This may have been suggested lay
Bishop Gisli. In any case, Bishop Gisli showed himself friend y towar s
Gubmundur‚ J6n’s son, whom he employed as secretragy after Gubmundur
had been unfrocked (cf. Mr. Olason’s introduction to J n
Ejdlmbour, pp. 22-23).
