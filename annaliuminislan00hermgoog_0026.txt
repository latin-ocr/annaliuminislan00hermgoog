The Annalium farrago and De mirabilibus are here printed
from a rotograph copy of the Bodleian manuscript. The ortho-
graphy of the manuscript has been followed where it was con·
sistently carried through, only a few manifest errors being
corrected. The manuscript use of y for i, or i for y, and also
that of oe and oe for e, or vice versa, as well as other peculiaritieS,
have been observed. The Icelandic words are given as written
in the original, except that an accent 1105 been put over vowels
in many cases where it was lacking ; but aa and isare reproduced
wherever they occur. The punctuation, on the other hand, for
the greater part is the work of the editor.

Like many of the prominent Icelanders of the earlier half of
the sixteenth century Bishop Gisli corresponded with Dr. Ole
Worm, the Danish archaeologist and physician.¹ He must have
made Worm's acquaintance while a student in the University.
In Olaz· Wormz'i et ad cum doctorum virorum Epistoloe (Havniae,
1751, tom. 11, pp. 594-597) extracts of two letters from the
bishop to Worm, and three letters from Worm to the bishop, are
printed. BesideS, there are in the Arna-Magaenan Collection
(AM. 267 fol.) five letters from the bishop to Worm.¹ 1 have
made use of all these letterS, so far as they are of any importance.
Worm was particularly anxious to secure information from
his correspondent concerning runeS, but, as has been shown
above, the bishop was unable to render him any service of con-
sequence. However‚ he did send him copies of certain old
annaIS‚⁸ and Worm in return sent the bishop some of his own
publication5.⁴ To Bishop Gisli, as to many otherS, Worm
was a noble and trusty friend.

⁴ Bishop Gisli also sent him natural objects from Iceland‚ and a chess-
board with chess-men (“ Jeg sennder eder ett shachtaffl med Christoffer
Bremmer paa det i kannd acte, huad ingenium Islandorum valet.'’ Aug.

8, 1637).
