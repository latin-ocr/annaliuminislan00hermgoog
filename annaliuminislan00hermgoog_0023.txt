and considerable space is given to a discussion of their seasonal
migrations; two chapters deal with insectS, and two with
domestic and wild animaIS. This is followed by a brief survey
of the principal geographical names of the country, including
those of fjords‚ islandS, riva-S, and mountains. Separate
chapters discnss Vestmanneyjar and Grimsey, the two principal
islandS. Next come chapters on the vegetable kingdom, on the κ
geology of the country, and on metaIS, stoneS, and springs of
various kinds, A chapter on caves suggests another on giantS, ἰ

the inhabitants of Iceland and their mode of living, occupations,
and accomplishmeuts ; here mention is made of some prominent
men of the time. The author concludes with a chapter on Ice-
landic women and their activitieS.

sharing and expressing the views of his contemporaries; yet it ξ
is gratifying to note how comparatively sound in many ways his ἱ
opinions are. The story of the activities of alleged sorcerers ξ
he in one place dismisses with a sneer ; of course, this does not
prove that he did not believe in witchcraft, but he was probably
more sceptical about it than many other educated men of his Ι
time.¹ We could better judge of his attitude toward the
