ii ISLANDICA

Bishop Gisli entered upon his episcopal duties with a de·
termination to correct many abuses in his diocese, and to bring
about reforms in various ways, This is evident from his three
interesting circular letters, addressed to the clergy and the
secular authorities,¹ which throw light upon the religious and
social conditions of the time. But he probably did not ac·
complish much, partly, doubtless, because of his short tenure of
office ; besideS, although a severe critic of existing abuses, he
was in his personality hardly a typical reformer. He appears
to have been a genial, conscientiouS, and unpretentious man—one,
as his enemies charged, rather given to drink. He enjoyed no
little popularity‚ and he was famed for his enormous physical
strength. The people were grateful to him for having brought
about the repeal of the tax law of 1631. This obnoxious
measure, one of many which, during the period of trade monopo-
ly, caused the financial ruin of Iceland, fixed exorbitant prices
on all imported merchandise, while the prices on native products
were lowered ; thus it was much more unfavorable to the Ice-
landic people than the tax law of 1619. The Althing protested
against the law, and petitioned the king to repeal it; but the
governor-general, who was a Dane, refused to support the
petition, or even to present it to the king. Afterhe was elected
bishop, Gisli took it upon himself to plead the cause of his
countrymen before the king. In this he was successful; the
law of 1631 was repealed‚ and that of 1619 remained in force.
Here he rendered a great service to the country.

Bishop Oddur Einarsson was an austere man, with a reputa-
tion for great learning, especially in astronomy and mathematicS,
having studied for some time under the famous Tycho Brahe.
A good linguist‚ he is said to have made many translations into

 

cousin. for which union a royal dispensation was necessary. Worm negoti-
ated the matter with the chancellor and the primate of Denmark, who seem
to have been reluctant to grant it. Who the lady was Ι do not know,
as the matter is not mentioned in any of Gisli’s letters which have been
preserved. About that time the bishop's younger brother contracted a
similar marriage (cf. J6n Halldorsson, Skblameistaraso'jgun p. 76), but
the reference in Worm’s letter seems to point to the bishop himself as ap-
plicant for the dispensation.
