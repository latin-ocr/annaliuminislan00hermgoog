Cap. . The Kommgs s uggy'd hasa deseri tion of the kasgusa (see
Munch’s ed. of 1848, p. 323 cf. also Fritzner’s Ordbssg over det gamle norske
S rog, 2d ed.‚ sub voce), and the author must have known that work.

he story about Paugbrand's celebratin a mass on the back of such a
monster is otherwise unknown, and it is c early a borrowing from the saga
of St. Brandan (see Heilagra manna δόξαν Ι, p. 274-275). In later Ice-
landic folk-lore a monster of that kind is usu y known as lyngbakur (cf.
J6n Arnason, ssliffijbbso'gur Ι, p. 631). .

coeg and Petrus Pomponius Ι have not been able to identify.

e tp. XXII. The kdlgresi referred to is what is now known as skarsakdl, '
oc cana.

Gap. XXIII. J ens Hoeselberg, the Danish merchant, is mentioned in
Icelandic sources es cially in connection with the redemption of the Ice-
landic captives in A geria. but his activities in fortifying the islands 1 have
not seen mentioned elsewhere. ,

cap. xxvn. As to the trec near Stafafell, cf. the tale about Reiflar-
artindnr, fsl. pjbbso‘gur ΙΙ, p. 66.

Cap. XXX. In connection with the author's account of himself and
his brother as having collected stones while traveling with their father, see
the tale about Bishop Oddur and the ‘⁸ stone of life,” fsl. pjbdsdgur Ι, p.
657.—About lausnarsteinar, see ibid. Ι, p. 649.

Cap. XXXII. In this chapter the author seems to have particularly
had in mind the caves undir Eyjafjfiuum, a district he knew well, havin
resided there for several years. One of them is call'ed Paradisarhellir; (εἰς.
Brynjolfur J 6nsson’s article on the caves there, in Arbbk bins isl. Fomleifa-

filag, 1902, pp. 24-29). A cave near Hitardalur is called Paradis (cf. ssl.
w’bbsbgun 11, p. 33).—The author’s explanation of the name of Sbttarhellir
is at variance with the one given in Isl. pjbbsdgur ΙΙ, . 97, although
another reference to it, ibid. Ι, . 185, seems to imply a di erent reason for
the name—For caves inhabite by bandits‚ see ibtd. ΙΙ, pp. 104ff.
