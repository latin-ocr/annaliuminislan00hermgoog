x ISLANDIC A

Peerse aud Dithmar Blefken pretended to give first-hand in·
formation about Iceland, asserting that they had visited its
shoreS, and traveled in the country. Accordingly, other writers
quoted ‘them as trustworthy authorities. Blefkeu’s book
especially had a wide circulation, and was translated into many
other languages; it has probably spread more misiuformation
about Iceland than any other single book. Needless to say, the
Icelanders felt indignant at such misleading and derogatory
publications‚ and wished thern to be refuted. A staunch defendet
soon appeared in the learned Arngrimur J6nsson, wh0, besides
three descriptive and historical works on his native land, wrote
two pamphlets iu refutation of Blefken and David Fabricius.¹
In his Brevis commentarius de Islandia (1593) Arngrimur dealt
with the physical geography of Iceland, the inhabitants, and
their mode of living, but the book was written throughout in a
controversial style.² His two later works (Crymogoea‚ 1609, and
Spectmen Islandioe historicum, 1643) were devoted to the history
and historical geography of the country. There is reason to
believe that Bishop Oddur Einarsson early planned to write a
description of Iceland, or something of that kind,⁸ and he actually
carried the plan out, at least to some extent ; but as the work is
now lost, we cannot precisely tell what were its character and
contente.. Bishop Gisli styles it Αὓτοσχεδίασμα, and gives a short
quotation from it.⁴ It is also known from P. Resen's Islandiae
nova descriptio, Resen having used it, together with many other
works.⁵ 1 am inclined to think that it was not a finished work,

⁸ Prior to Arngrimur Jonsson, Oddur Einarsson was deemed the most ca -
able person to refute the mistaken assertions of foreign writers about Icelang.
This may be gathered from the letter Bishop Gubbrandur of H61ar wrote to
the clergy of the Skalholt diocese, recommending the election of Oddur for
bishop. He intimates that Oddur, in view of his great learning, will be
able ‘⁴ lastskriptum svar αδ gesa, sem fit eru geingnar um vort foburland
og ganga kunna ” (J6n Halldorsson, Biskupa so'gur 1, p. 164).
