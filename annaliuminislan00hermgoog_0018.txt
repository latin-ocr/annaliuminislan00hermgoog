INTRODUCTION vii

natural history, although his principle of selection is not very
clear. The earlier items (1106-1402) are of no consequence;
they have been copied, as Storm has shown, from earlier sources,
such as the so-called ΟιιῖιιῖιιΜνῙιι-ιιηηάΙΙι and Lyskander’s Dcn
grbnlandske Cronica.² The rest is compiled from contemporary
sources which are now lost, chiefly from private letters written
by various people to Bishop Oddur and the author himself.
Some events are described from the author’s own observation.
He says in the postscript that he only included things he con·
sidered true or probable, and supported by good authority. It
would be interesting if we knew some of the material he rejected
as untrustworthy, so as to find the criterion he applied in his
selectionS. But his was a superstitious age. One can at all
events gather from this work what were the principal news-items
of the day, so that in this respect also the compilation is of
value. Important is the information given about the various
plagues that devastated the country, especially those of 1492
’ (1494) and 1636, and concerning volcanic eruptions, such as
that of Hekla in 1636, and others ; but the author's chronology
is not always to be trusted. Interesting likewise is the story of
the ordeal of the bier (1598), not elsewhere mentioned so far as

1 know, but the authority for it unfortunately is not given.³

that the Oddaverja-ann ll was written by Vigffis Jonsson. In any case these
annals were in the possession of his son, Ormur Vigffisson ί d, 1675), who
was steward of the· Skalhoflt epislclopliil·seatf1133thle² timgiwlliien1133i{111331121331-3111(J·}<i§1fft

of Gisli Arnason, whom Bishop Gisli succeeded as minister of Holt undu
Eyjafjollum in 1623. Bishop Gisli must have horrowed the manuscript
from Ormur. For these annals, see Islandske Annaler indtil 1578, ed. by
Gustav Storm (Christiania, 1888), pp. xxxviii—lxvi, 427-491.

¹ Claus Christoffersen Lyskander (1558-ca. 1624), a credulous and un-
trustworthy writer, published his metrical- chronicle, Den grdnlandske
Cronica in Copenh en, 1608. Among the sources of his chronicle were
the annale (Gottskffis αηηάίαν) written by Gottskalk 6nsson (1524-93)‚
minister of Glaumbaer, which were edited by Storm in εἰς A urg-aler, (iffi).

³As the event is said to have occurred in Dalasysla (Fellsstriind) which
at that time was held by J 611 Magnfisson, who corresponded with Bishop
Oddur (cf. . 12, 28 , it is possible that the former is the authority for
the story. {ge belie in similar ordea] is shown in the tale “Upp koma
